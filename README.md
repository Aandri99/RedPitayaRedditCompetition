# Red Pitaya Reaction Time Measurement Game

This project involves a reaction time measurement application developed using Python in JupyterNotebook, targeting integration with the Red Pitaya board. The software is designed to assess user reaction times based on visual cues (colored circles) and button presses. Key components include a user interface for displaying instructions and results, threading for timekeeping, and data management features to maintain and display a leaderboard.

The application's flow starts by inviting users to initiate the test, followed by a randomized waiting period marked by a red circle. Once the green circle appears, users must react by pressing a button, recording their reaction time. If users react prematurely (before the green circle), they're directed to a retry state. After each session, the reaction time is recorded, and the software updates a leaderboard reflecting top performers. Users can also switch between viewing their reaction time statistics and the leaderboard.

Additional features include email and company data collection for a more personalized experience, and statistical analysis with histogram and Gaussian fit plotting to visualize overall performance distributions among participants. This setup is intended for interactive public or educational displays, emphasizing engagement and competition.
